  You are about to venture the unknown depths of outer space: 
  Go, where no ABAP code has ever gone before: Into the realms where there's no Netweaver.

  Howver, be aware: st this statge, a netweaver-less ABAP is only a proof of concept:
  Hardly any language features are supported - yet.
  Feel free to experiment and contribute though!

  Under the hood, this template scaffolds a transpilation of your ABAP source to Javascript.
  It will also execute only this Javascript. 

  Unit tests are run at build time via "npm run", edit package.json to specify 
  how you want to execute them.
